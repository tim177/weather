# Weather App

This is a React-based weather application that provides users with location-based weather forecasts, multi-day forecasts, geolocation functionality, unit conversion options, and the ability to view historical weather data (if supported by the weather API).

## Features

### Location-based Weather

- Users can search for weather forecasts by city name or ZIP code.
- The application displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

### Forecast for Multiple Days

- Provides a multi-day weather forecast (e.g., a 5-day forecast) for the selected location.
- Displays forecast details for each day, including high and low temperatures.

### Geolocation

- Implements geolocation to automatically detect the user's current location.
- Displays the weather forecast for the detected location.

### Unit Conversion

- Allows users to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius/Fahrenheit, metric/imperial) for temperature, wind speed, etc.

### Historical Weather Data

- If supported by the weather API, the application may include a feature to show historical weather data for a specific date.
